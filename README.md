# Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Training Workshop

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Training Workshop** repository! This workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge in two main areas of cyber defense and investigations:

1. **Part One: Social Engineering and E-Mail Phishing**  
2. **Part Two: Network Attacks (Detection and Analysis)**

You’ll also find bonus materials on **Digital Watermarking** and how it applies to file integrity, medical images, biometric data, and evidence protection.


## Overview

This workshop aims to equip participants with:
- **Practical Skills**: Detecting and analyzing phishing emails, network-based attacks, and common security threats.  
- **Forensic Techniques**: Preserving digital evidence, analyzing network packets (PCAP files), and identifying manipulation or tampering.  
- **Awareness**: Understanding how social engineering attacks work and how to mitigate them.  
- **Advanced Topics**: Digital watermarking for protecting intellectual property, evidence ownership, and privacy in sensitive fields like healthcare and law enforcement.

## Workshop Outline

### Part One: Social Engineering & E-Mail Phishing
1. **Basics of Social Engineering**  
   - Psychological manipulation, phishing techniques, and real-world examples.
2. **Phishing Simulation**  
   - Crafting a phishing email, distributing to a test group, analyzing responses.
3. **E-Mail Forensics**  
   - Inspecting email headers, attachments, and links; analyzing authenticity (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

### Part Two: Network Attacks – Detection & Forensic Analysis
1. **Common Network Attacks**  
   - ARP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing, DoS/DDoS, MITM, and Sniffing.
2. **Packet Capture & Analysis**  
   - Using Wireshark, tcpdump, and other tools to analyze PCAP files.
3. **Intrusion Detection Systems**  
   - Overview of Snort, Suricata, and how to set up basic rules.

### Bonus: Digital Watermarking for Security and Justice
- **Embedding Watermarks**: Medical images, biometric data, and official documents.  
- **Forgery Detection**: Identifying manipulated files via AI or manual inspection.  
- **Case Studies**: Practical applications in law enforcement, healthcare, and digital rights management.

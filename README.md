# Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Training Workshop

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Training Workshop** repository! This workshop aims to provide hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge across four main parts of cyber defense and investigations:

1. **Part One: Social Engineering & E-Mail Phishing**  
2. **Part Two: Digital File Analysis & Information Extraction**  
3. **Part Three: Digital Watermarking for Security & Justice**  
4. **Part Four: Network Attacks (Detection & Analysis)**


## Overview

This workshop equips participants with:
- **Practical Skills**: Detecting and analyzing phishing emails, forensic examination of digital files, network-based attacks, and more.
- **Forensic Techniques**: Preserving and examining digital evidence, analyzing packet captures (PCAP files), and identifying manipulations.
- **Awareness**: Understanding social engineering tactics, leveraging watermarking technologies, and applying best practices in network security.
- **Advanced Topics**: Incorporating digital watermarking to protect intellectual property, verifying authenticity of images/documents, and performing thorough network forensics.


## Workshop Outline

### Part One: Social Engineering & E-Mail Phishing
1. **Social Engineering Fundamentals**  
   - Psychological tactics, common phishing approaches, and real-world examples.
2. **Phishing Simulation**  
   - Creating a phishing email, distributing it to a test group, and analyzing results.
3. **E-Mail Forensics**  
   - Inspecting headers, links, and attachments; focusing on SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

### Part Two: Digital File Analysis & Information Extraction
1. **File Metadata and Integrity**  
   - Understanding EXIF metadata, checksums, and hashing (MD5, SHA256) for integrity checks.
2. **Document and Image Analysis**  
   - Techniques for identifying hidden or manipulated data, steganographic methods, and forensic tools.
3. **Hands-On Exercises**  
   - Analyzing sample files using specialized tools (ExifTool, binwalk, Foremost).

### Part Three: Digital Watermarking for Security & Justice
1. **Watermarking Basics**  
   - What watermarking is, types (visible vs. invisible), and the importance in legal contexts.
2. **Practical Applications**  
   - Embedding unique marks in medical images, legal documents, and multimedia files to prevent tampering.
3. **Advanced Techniques & Tools**  
   - AI-based watermark detection, embedding biometric data, forging detection methods.

### Part Four: Network Attacks (Detection & Analysis)
1. **Common Network Threats**  
   - ARP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing, DoS/DDoS attacks, and MITM.
2. **Packet Capture & Analysis**  
   - Using Wireshark, tcpdump, and other tools to analyze PCAP files.
3. **Intrusion Detection**  
   - Setting up basic IDS (Snort, Suricata) and understanding how to respond to alerts.
